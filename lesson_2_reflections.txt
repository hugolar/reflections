What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates the structure of files like .git to track all files and be a working repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows us to make changes and thest them before moving them to the working directory or rol back the changes with no impact to our production environment

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can add one file at a time to ensure each commit has one logical change
